## Changelog — UX Overhaul

### Change 3: Remove Pocket Dad from Home Screen — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Removed `import PocketDadCard from 'components/PocketDadCard'`
- Removed `<PocketDadCard onPressCta={...} />` JSX block from Home screen
- `components/PocketDadCard.tsx` and `components/PocketDadSignupModal.tsx` are now dead code (not deleted, just unused)
- The Dad Chat tab (`saythis.tsx`) still calls the Pocket Dad API — that's the feature itself, just the promo card was removed

### Change 2: Fix Dad Chat Whitespace — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/saythis.tsx`
- Changed header padding from `py-3` (12px) to `py-2` (8px) on the header View
- The screen uses `SafeAreaView edges={['top']}` which correctly handles notch/Dynamic Island
- Reduced gap between safe area inset and "Dad Chat" title text

### Change 6: Overall UX Polish — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`, `components/ChildrenGrid.tsx`, `app/_layout.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- **Sign-in button**: Changed from gray `bg-slate-800` to gold `#c4a471` when form is filled. Disabled state is still gray.
- **Access code font**: Changed to monospace (`Menlo` on iOS, `monospace` on Android), increased to `text-3xl`, letterSpacing 8
- **Screen transitions**: Added `animation: 'fade'` to root Stack screenOptions
- **Tab bar labels**: Increased fontWeight from `'500'` to `'600'` for better active tab distinction (active color already `#c4a471`)

### Change 4: Redesign Home Screen Story Prompts — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Removed `TryThisCard` component usage and import
- Removed `getAllCategories`, `getPromptsByCategory` imports from constants
- Removed single-prompt state: `prompt`, `shufflesLeft`, `promptCategory`, `shufflePrompt()`, initial prompt useEffect
- Added `STORY_PROMPTS` constant (10 prompts with emoji, title, subtitle) outside the component
- Added `pickRandomPrompts(count)` utility function
- Added `activePrompts` state initialized with 4 random picks
- Prompts refresh on each screen focus via `useFocusEffect`
- 2x2 grid layout with white card backgrounds, rounded corners (14px), subtle shadow, border
- Each card navigates to capture screen with `selectedPrompt: p.title`
- "Story Prompts" section title added above the grid

### Change 1: Kids Portal Login on Login Screen — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`
- Files created: `app/kids/_layout.tsx`, `app/kids/code-entry.tsx`
- Added "Are you a kid?" divider below "Sign up here" link
- Added dark navy "Enter Kid's Code" button with play-circle icon
- Button navigates to `/kids/code-entry` via Expo Router Link
- **KidsCodeEntry screen**:
  - Logo (smaller), "Enter Your Code" header, "Ask your dad" subtext
  - 6-character PIN input with individual rounded boxes (48x58px)
  - Active box border is gold `#c4a471`, error state is red
  - Auto-advance on input, auto-submit when all 6 filled
  - Paste support (first box accepts full code)
  - Backspace moves to previous box
  - Validates against `children.access_code` column in Supabase
  - On success: stores kid session in AsyncStorage (`kids_session` key) and navigates to `/kids/feed`
  - On failure: shake animation (react-native-reanimated), inline error message, clears inputs
  - Back button returns to sign-in screen
- Decision: Used 6-char code length to match `generateChildAccessCode(length = 6)` default

### Change 5: Kids TikTok-Style Feed — ✅ Complete
- Files created: `app/kids/feed.tsx`
- **Fullscreen vertical feed**: FlatList with `pagingEnabled`, `snapToInterval={SCREEN_HEIGHT}`
- **Video playback**: expo-av Video component, auto-play active item, pause inactive, loop enabled
- **Tap to play/pause**: Single tap toggles with brief play icon overlay animation
- **Double-tap hearts**: Detects double-tap (300ms window), renders animated heart at tap location (scale up + fade out over 650ms)
- **Love batching**: Accumulates double-tap counts per memory, flushes via `increment_love` RPC after 750ms debounce
- **Memory type detection**: Checks both `videos` and `narrations` tables to determine type before calling RPC
- **Content fetching**:
  - Loads kid session from AsyncStorage
  - Queries `children` table for child info
  - Queries `video_children` for video assignments, then `videos` for video records
  - Queries `narrations` filtered by `selected_children` containing child ID
  - Generates signed URLs for video files, thumbnails, audio, and images from Supabase Storage
  - Filters by unlock status (now/date/age/milestone logic matching web repo)
  - Sorts newest first
- **Locked content**: Shows lock icon with "More stories are coming!" at end of feed
- **Empty state**: Shows Hey Dad logo with "Dad hasn't recorded any stories yet"
- **Audio stories**: Display with background image and gradient overlay, "Audio Story" label
- **Exit flow**: Three-dot menu (top-right) → "Exit" clears AsyncStorage session → navigates to sign-in
- **Menu**: Popover with backdrop dismiss, positioned below menu button
- Decision: Used direct Supabase queries from client (no server API) since the web repo uses server-side JWT sessions but mobile stores session locally
- Decision: Did NOT create new `kid_love_events` table — assumes it already exists from web repo migrations

## Changelog — Round 2 Fixes (Post-Testing)

### Fix 1: Kids Code Entry Validation Bug — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/kids/code-entry.tsx`
- **Root cause**: Used `.single()` which throws `PGRST116` error when no rows found, making it indistinguishable from real DB/RLS errors
- Changed `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` — returns `null` instead of an error when no rows match
- Split error handling: DB/RLS errors now show "Something went wrong" vs invalid code shows "That code didn't work"
- Added `console.error` logging for real errors to aid debugging
- Catch block now also shows "Something went wrong" instead of masking JS errors as invalid codes
- Note: `toUpperCase()` normalization is correct — access code alphabet (`23456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ`) is all uppercase
- **Important**: If codes still fail, check RLS policies on `children` table — anon key needs select access on `access_code` column

### Fix 6: Update Home Screen Subtitle — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Changed subtitle from "Record something now. Talk about a photo, add a quick note, or record a video" to "One day, this will mean everything."

### Fix 3: Remove "Record Your Own Thing" Section — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Removed entire "Record Your Own Thing" section (title + 3 icon buttons: Tell a Story, Video Story, Write a Story)
- These actions are still accessible via the prompt cards and the hero CTA button

### Fix 2: Replace Subscription Banner with Personalized Hero CTA — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Removed `LinearGradient` import (no longer used)
- Removed old gold gradient banner showing subscription/trial status and "Get Story Pack" button
- Added new hero CTA card with:
  - "TODAY'S STORY" label with videocam icon in gold
  - Personalized title: "Record a video for {child_name}" (uses first child's name, or "Record your first story" if no children)
  - Warm subtitle: "They'll thank you for this someday."
  - Gold "Start Recording" button navigating to video capture
- Dark mode support with appropriate background/text colors
- Card has white background, rounded corners, subtle border and shadow

### Fix 4: "Your Legacy So Far" Stats Section — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Added new section between Story Prompts and modals area
- Three stat cards in a row:
  - **Total Stories**: `videos.length + narrations.length`
  - **This Month**: count of videos + narrations created in current calendar month
  - **Kids Watching**: `children.length`
- Each card has: icon in warm circle background, large number, uppercase label
- Gold accent icons (`#c4a471`), consistent card styling with border and shadow
- Dark mode support

### Fix 5: Visual Depth Pass — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- **Background**: Changed light mode from `bg-gray-100` (#f3f4f6) to warm gray `#F8F7F5`
- **Card borders**: Changed from `#e5e7eb` to warmer `#e8e5e0` in light mode
- **Hero CTA shadows**: Increased from `shadowOpacity: 0.08, shadowRadius: 8` to `0.10, 12`
- **Prompt card shadows**: Increased from `shadowOpacity: 0.05, shadowRadius: 3` to `0.08, 6`
- **Prompt cards**: Added gold left border (`borderLeftWidth: 3, borderLeftColor: '#c4a471'`)
- **Emoji circles**: Wrapped prompt emojis in warm-toned circles (`#FBF7F0` light, `#374151` dark)
- **Stat card shadows**: Increased to match prompt cards
- **Stat icon backgrounds**: Changed to warm `#FBF7F0` (light mode)
- **Bottom spacing**: Added 32px bottom padding to ScrollView content
- All elevation values increased from 2 to 3–4 for Android depth

## Changelog — Round 3 Fixes (Post-Testing)

### Fix 7: Hero CTA Copy — Remove Pronouns — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Removed all pronoun-based subtext ("They'll thank you for this someday.")
- New subtext: "This will mean the world one day." — always the same, no pronouns
- Headline now picks a random child name on each render (or "Record a video for your kids" if none)
- No `getPronoun()` or gender references existed in codebase — confirmed clean
- No gender column on `children` table — confirmed

### Fix 1: Legacy Section Scroll Bug — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Removed `stickyHeaderIndices={[1]}` from ScrollView (was causing layout calculation issues)
- Added `contentContainerStyle={{ paddingBottom: 100 }}` to ScrollView to clear tab bar
- Added `minHeight: 120` and `justifyContent: 'center'` to stat cards to prevent collapse
- Changed legacy section container from NativeWind classes to explicit `style` for reliable layout
- Removed old `<View style={{ height: 32 }} />` bottom spacer (now handled by contentContainerStyle)

### Fix 3: Convert Prompts to Horizontal Slider — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Replaced 2x2 grid with horizontal `FlatList` (`RNFlatList`)
- Added `Dimensions` and `FlatList as RNFlatList` imports
- Card sizing: 160x180px fixed, shows ~2.2 cards at a time
- Shows all 10 prompts in order (no longer randomly picks 4)
- Removed `pickRandomPrompts()` function and `activePrompts` state
- Added "See All Prompts" card at end — navigates to existing `(tabs)/memories/ideas` screen
- `snapToInterval={PROMPT_CARD_WIDTH + 12}` with `decelerationRate="fast"` for snapping
- Reduced "Story Prompts" header to 16px semibold to save vertical space

### Fix 2: Bold Masculine Color Overhaul — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- **Background**: Changed from `#F8F7F5` to warm linen `#F5F3EF`
- **Hero CTA**: Replaced flat white card with dark gradient `LinearGradient` from `#1B2838` to `#2C3E50`
  - Gold `#D4A853` for label, button, and accents
  - White headline on dark background — premium feel
  - Button has gold glow shadow: `shadowColor: '#D4A853', shadowOpacity: 0.3`
  - Button text is dark navy on gold (reversed contrast)
- **Prompt cards**: Stronger shadow (`shadowOpacity: 0.12, shadowRadius: 12`), 4px gold left border with `#D4A853`, dark navy `#1B2838` title text

### Fix 4: Dad Chat Whitespace + Kids Photos — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/saythis.tsx`
- Replaced `SafeAreaView edges={['top']}` with `<View style={{ paddingTop: insets.top + 8 }}>` using `useSafeAreaInsets()`
- Header now uses `pb-2` only (no `py-2`), removing top padding entirely — snug to safe area
- Removed "Chatting about {name}" subtitle line from header to save space
- Added `Image` import from react-native
- Added `childAvatars` state with signed URL fetching from `child-images` storage bucket
- Updated children query to include `image_path` column
- Child selector chips now show circular profile photos (28px diameter) + name
- Placeholder initial (dark navy circle, white letter) when no photo
- Active chip has gold border `#D4A853` with subtle gold background tint
- Inactive chip has gray border, no fill

### Fix 5: Dad Chat UX Personality — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/saythis.tsx`
- **Empty state redesigned**:
  - Replaced generic `chatbubbles-outline` icon with Hey Dad logo (`assets/logo.png`) in warm 80px circle
  - Header changed from "Dad Chat" to "What's on your mind, Dad?" — left-aligned, 22px semibold, dark navy

  - White arrow icon on gold background

### Fix 6: Dad Chat Input Placeholder Text — ✅ Complete
- Files modified: `app/(tabs)/saythis.tsx`
- Changed from "Ask me anything about being a dad..." to "What's on your mind?"

## Known Issues
- `kid_love_events` table and `increment_love` RPC must exist in Supabase (created by web repo migration `20260210_kid_love_events.sql`). If the migration hasn't been applied, love events will fail silently.
- `PocketDadCard.tsx` and `PocketDadSignupModal.tsx` are dead code — can be safely deleted if desired.
- `TryThisCard.tsx` is now dead code — only used by the old single-prompt card.
- The kids feed doesn't have audio playback for `audio` type stories — it displays them visually but doesn't auto-play the audio. This could be added as a follow-up.
- Access code validation now uses `.maybeSingle()` for proper error handling. If codes still fail, verify RLS policies on `children` table allow anon select on `access_code`.
- Hero CTA picks a random child name on each render — this means it can change if the component re-renders. If consistent names are desired, use `useMemo` or state to pin it per session.
- The `SafeAreaView` import in `saythis.tsx` is replaced with `useSafeAreaInsets` — the `react-native-safe-area-context` package is still a dependency.
